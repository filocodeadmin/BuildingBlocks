Every repo contains a README, which is a document that is intended to explain, at first glance, what a project does and how to install or test the code.

READMEs are really important because theyâ€™re the first item a user will see when encountering your code. Creating a readable README ensures that your co-workers and the public will be able to understand the intention of your program, install the software, and fork and adapt your projects.


## A description of what the project is for.

This should answer a short list of basic questions:

* **What is this repo or project?**

This project provides both a means of content to present personal capabilities and also a starter project for programmers that would like to use it as a foundation for larger projects.  The code isn't overly complicated, but it's more of the structure that's important.

* **How does it work?**
* **Who will use this repo or project?**
* **What is the goal of this project?**
